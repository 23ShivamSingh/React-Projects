# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Step-1 Unzip the public.zip file:
       Locate the public.zip file on your system and unzip it. This will create the following folders:
         node_modules
         public
         src
Step-2 Organize the folders:
         Ensure that the node_modules, public, and src folders are placed in the same directory as the other files.
Step-3 Open the folder in Visual Studio Code:
         Launch Visual Studio Code and navigate to the folder containing all the files, including the unzipped folders.
Step-4 Explore your files:
         Once the folder is open in VS Code, you can start working with your project files.
